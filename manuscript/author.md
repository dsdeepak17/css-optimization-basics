  _On Web Development_ bundles 134 articles and the last 11 years of technical writings by Jens Oliver Meiert (meiert.com). Freshly reordered and commented, the articles cover processes and maintenance, HTML and CSS, standards, as well as development and design in general; they range from coding basics and principles, to carefully scathing criticism, to tips and tricks and trivia.

* [_The Little Book of HTML/CSS Frameworks_](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-little-book/9781492048121/) (2015):

  With the speed of web development today, it’s little wonder that so many frameworks are available, since they come with a promise of saving development and design time. But using the wrong framework, or wrongly using the right framework, can be costly. This concise book shares higher-level ideas around web development frameworks that govern HTML and CSS code, whether you’re looking at an external option or planning to build your own.

* [_100 Things I Learned as an Everyday Adventurer_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GAC2SJI/?tag=j9t-21-20) (2013):

  This is the book that the most boring person would write when they discovered life’s possibilities. Meet Jens, a hectic, neurotic self-proclaimed adventurer, and his very individual account of one hundred different activities he tried over the course of three years (2010–2013). From rafting to security guard certifications to crocheting, everything had a lesson, and these lessons are shared in this book. Look forward to the German answer to Winston Wolfe explaining one way how to live a life.
