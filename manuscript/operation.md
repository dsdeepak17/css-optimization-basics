# Operational Optimization

In this first part of optimization, operational optimization, we’re going to talk about the options we have to write higher quality CSS while we’re right at them—in operation. (The second part will deal with options to optimize for production, that is, for release.)

Just as it didn’t seem useful to cover preprocessors so to get a clear look at CSS itself, we’re not going to discuss documentation, as with in-file comments, nor (most) guidelines that we can put in effect automatically. Documentation is an entirely different topic that has more to do with maintenance than with optimization, and coding guidelines, as important as they are and as many of them we can set up, are often a matter of preference that does not have a bearing on quality (also see: [_The Little Book of HTML/CSS Coding Guidelines_](http://www.oreilly.com/web-platform/free/little-book-html-css-coding-guidelines.csp)). We’re hence already applying two of our mantras: to keep it simple, and to automate.
