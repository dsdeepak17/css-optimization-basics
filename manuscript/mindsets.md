# Development Mindsets

We all know the adage, “Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.” To me, we feed developers for a lifetime by teaching and cherishing certain _mindsets_. They are not enough, _per se_, but I view them as the foundation that decides where we’re headed with our work and our careers; they’re not all related to CSS optimization—that would be odd for us web developers—, but they’re so useful, let’s look at the key ones.

## Do One Thing Really, Really Well

Out of [the Google book](https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html), one wonderful idea is to do things really, really well. But I used the plural here, and Google uses singular for a reason, and for us here as web developers this thing should be _web development_.

To do one thing really well means to really kneel into web development, to pierce through it, to fully understand it, to practice it, to master it, to do it really well. Optimizing CSS is part of writing CSS well is part of doing web development well, and that’s why this mindset is important for us. The goal to do web development well is an idea that serves us in our work.

## Know Your Needs

An idea occasionally forgotten, and not strictly followed, is the one of knowing our needs—of knowing our needs _well_. It’s actually the idea of knowing, or having in the first place, our _goals_—because our goals likewise determine the specific needs we have.

Knowing our goals and needs is important because evidently, it’s difficult to meet a goal when we don’t know it, and to satisfy a need that we’re ignorant of. In the web development world, there are many goals and needs we may have: from most important goals how to maintain our projects (from a destructive [“fire and forget”](https://meiert.com/en/blog/fire-and-forget/) to a very efficient process of iteration) to clearly quantified performance, and from basal needs like a framework that [covers our design but doesn’t mean bloat](http://www.oreilly.com/web-platform/free/book-of-html-css-frameworks.csp), to decisive ones like automation tools.

## Stay in the Present

Without becoming overly self-helpish or even philosophical, a useful mindset for us is to also stay in the present, to stay in the now. It means both a rigid eye to get rid of, that is, archive everything—concepts, documentation, patterns, code snippets, libraries, &c.—that we don’t need (“Know Your Needs”) and use anymore, and care not to already code (or even plan to code) something that we don’t, _with certainty_, know to come.

This mindset matters because it keeps our code base and our documentation as clean as possible, and hence contributes significantly to clear focus (“Do One Thing Really, Really Well”, “Keep It Simple”).
