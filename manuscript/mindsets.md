# Development Mindsets

We all know the adage, “Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.” To me, we feed developers for a lifetime by teaching and cherishing certain _mindsets_. They are not enough, _per se_, but I view them as the foundation that decides where we’re headed with our work and our careers; they’re not all related to CSS optimization—that would be odd for us web developers—, but they’re so useful, let’s look at the key ones.

## Do One Thing Really, Really Well

Out of [the Google book](https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html), one wonderful idea is to do things really, really well. But I used the plural here, and Google uses singular for a reason, and for us here as web developers this thing should be _web development_.

To do one thing really well means to really kneel into web development, to pierce through it, to fully understand it, to practice it, to master it, to do it really well. Optimizing CSS is part of writing CSS well is part of doing web development well, and that’s why this mindset is important for us. The goal to do web development well is an idea that serves us in our work.

## Know Your Needs

An idea occasionally forgotten, and not strictly followed, is the one of knowing our needs—of knowing our needs _well_. It’s actually the idea of knowing our _goals_, or having them in the first place—because our goals likewise determine the specific needs we have.

Knowing our goals and needs is important because evidently, it’s difficult to meet a goal when we don’t know it, and to satisfy a need that we’re ignorant of. In the web development world, there are many goals and needs we may have: from most important goals like how to maintain our projects (from a destructive [“fire and forget”](https://meiert.com/en/blog/fire-and-forget/) to a very efficient process of iteration) to clearly quantified performance, and from basal needs like frameworks that [cover our design ideas but don’t mean bloat](http://www.oreilly.com/web-platform/free/book-of-html-css-frameworks.csp), to decisive ones like automation tools.

## Stay in the Present

Without becoming overly self-helpish or even philosophical, a useful mindset for us is to also stay in the present, to stay in the now. It means both a rigid eye to get rid of, that is, archive everything—concepts, documentation, patterns, code snippets, libraries, &c.—that we don’t need and use anymore (“Know Your Needs”), and care not to already code (or even plan to code) something that we don’t, _with certainty_, know to come.

This mindset matters because it keeps our code base and our documentation as clean, and hence contributes significantly to our focus (“Do One Thing Really, Really Well”, “Keep It Simple”).

## Keep It Simple

The idea to keep it simple has a lazy touch, and yet it requires high skill. Keeping it simple really means _focus_, to know what’s important, and _through that_ be efficient. Keeping it simple does not mean to simply do less; it means to do what matters.

As such, keeping things simple requires that we thoroughly understand our field—the core technologies, first and foremost, but everything in between and to the sides as well. And it means true economy of motion, because we don’t want to engage in something that doesn’t need to be done.

As a mindset, keeping it simple is truly grandiose, and the interested reader may not want to pick up a book on minimalism but rather one about focus—my recommendation is Gary Keller’s [_The One Thing_](https://www.the1thing.com/).

## Automate

Lastly, a most powerful mindset as loosely as we’re working with them here, is the one to automate. Every step of our work should, if it can, be automated. Sometimes that will be obvious—every time after we made CSS changes we run some optimization script—, sometimes that will require a bit of listening—a team member mentions how he manually updates documentation each time someone reports downtime issues—, and at other times it will be obscure—no one even knew that there was the option to automate visual design regression testing.

Whenever we repeat something in our work, we should look into whether that repeat work can be handled through a script or tool—no matter how “hacky” the solution may be. (Personally, I work with a recurring reminder to think through my work and check for automation options.) And then it requires attention, for automation is powerful. And still it doesn’t “take work away”—but it liberates us to do the more important things.
