# Overview

CSS optimization is important because we, especially not as teams, don’t write only perfectly efficient and maintainable and understandable code.

Writing such code, quality code, however, is what makes us professionals.

CSS optimization does not entail “everything” that can be done in CSS or through tools; it entails what makes it more efficient and maintainable and understandable while achieving a good balance.

As professionals, we benefit from doing one (or two, but not eighty-five) things really, really well; as web developers, it’s not a bad idea if CSS is one of these things.

It’s useful when we know our needs.

It’s practical when we develop for the present.

It makes our work easier when we keep it simple.

There’s nothing wrong with doing less work—by automating it.

There’s nothing wrong, either, with not doing work that was automated.

(There’s much wrong with not doing the work that we haven’t yet automated, however.)

Code should be understandable, and for that it’s useful when code is consistent and simple.

Consistent CSS is footed on alphabetical declaration sorting (the rest is too complicated even when opening our mouths) and on a rough order for selector sorting.

Simple CSS may avoid IDs and classes altogether and uses functional or generic names.

Simple CSS also likes shorthands (yes).

Speed is important.

In CSS, selector performance doesn’t matter, and inline CSS is a crime in many countries.

(Web development is not software development.)

Some declarations may be slower than others but there’s rarely reason for panic.

Rule hygiene may be most important for CSS performance.

Quality is the mark of professional work.

The most basic way way to determine quality is through validation, and high error counts are not high quality scores.

Every piece of code gets at least touched _twice_.

Web design is a process.

For these two reasons, maintainability and maintenance are critical.

`!important` is not an obstacle to maintenance; it’s a tool.

One of the most important principles is separation of concerns, and contents, structure, presentation, behavior are all different concerns.

In code, we don’t want to repeat ourselves.

Accordingly, we do want to limit the repetition of declarations.

Optimization for production is an important second step, because in production machines use our code, whereas in operation, humans use it.

When we cannot production-optimize automatically, we should do as much as we can manually.

For production, we remove all unneeded characters. All of them.

We typically want to reference one style sheet that includes all the styles, though there are cases of high complexity in which a different approach can lead to higher performance.

(We cannot be absolved from making decisions about our particular project.)

(Exceptions prove the rule.)

We regularly review our CSS, both pre-production and in production.

We are professionals and we aim for quality work.

As professionals we are aware of our responsibilities, we hold ourselves accountable, and we set high ethical standards for ourselves.

And, as professionals, we lead by example.
