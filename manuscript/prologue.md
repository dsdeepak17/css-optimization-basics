This is a self-published book made with little extra help. If you find mistakes in it, you have all reason to blame the author—but also a great opportunity to help make the book a little better, and to be named as a contributor. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/j9t/css-optimization-basics/issues/new) for every problem you find, or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/j9t/css-optimization-basics/pulls) for specific fixes and suggestions. If you bought the book [through Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/css-optimization-basics) you should get updates containing your and other people’s fixes automatically. (Otherwise there’s always [the original source](https://github.com/j9t/css-optimization-basics).)

Thank you for your support, your understanding, and your help.
