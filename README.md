# CSS Optimization Basics: An Open Living Book

This is the growing source of the open and living book _CSS Optimization Basics_. It‚Äôs a short book by O‚ÄôReilly author and former Google tech lead [Jens Oliver Meiert](https://meiert.com/en/) (or short: Jens).

You soon have two options to get the book.

1. You can read the book here, for free.
2. You can get an electronic copy, likely starting at Amazon, for almost free.

In the first and initial version of _CSS Optimization Basics_, there are probably some errors and typos and everything. There will also be more that not only could but _should_ be said about CSS optimization. (Notice the introduction though, the book is a lot about the _craft_ of writing CSS, and it talks about basics for a reason üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.)

Because of this early state of things, note two other options:

1. [File an issue](@@) for every problem you find‚Äîand get mentioned as a book contributor.
2. [Submit a pull request](@@) for specific fixes and suggestions‚Äîand to get mentioned as a book contributor.

With increasing quality and maturity of the book, the price of ebook will go up (probably up to the price of [some of Jens‚Äôs self-published books](https://www.amazon.com/Jens-Oliver-Meiert/e/B0045A1CDA?tag=j9t-21-20)). That still won‚Äôt be much for a tech book, even a short one, but the idea is to give those who buy a copy now a good deal. Note that everyone can always grab the free version or an update here, so whoever‚Äôs purchasing a copy‚Äîand that would greatly help Jens‚Äôs work‚Äîplease keep that in mind, as book _updates_ may or may not be available for Amazon ebooks.

This just quickly typed down for a start. The book will be open as everything‚Äôs public and free, and it‚Äôs living as it‚Äôs going to be maintained both by Jens as well as everyone who likes to help make it better.

Oh. One bonus thing. Jens had only asked one expert peer whether he wanted to write the foreword, and that expert never got back to him. If you have a nice foreword‚Äîthat may span 1‚Äì2 pages and may well cover your own view on CSS optimization‚Äîgo for it and [let Jens know](https://meiert.com/en/contact/) about the intent and what you have written. We‚Äôll sort out the details then. ü•Ç
