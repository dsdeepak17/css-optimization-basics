# CSS Optimization Basics: An Open Living Book

This is the source of the open and living book [_CSS Optimization Basics_](https://leanpub.com/css-optimization-basics) by Oâ€™Reilly author and former Google tech lead [Jens Oliver Meiert](https://meiert.com/en/) (short: Jens).

You have two options to get the book.

1. You can read the book here, for free.
2. You can [purchase a nicer electronic copy](https://leanpub.com/css-optimization-basics) for a small amount.

In the first and initial version of _CSS Optimization Basics_, there are probably some errors and typos and everything. There will also be more that not only could but _should_ be said about CSS optimization. (Note that the book is a lot about the _craft_ and the _basics_ of writing CSS though.)

Because of this early state of things, note two other options:

1. [File an issue](https://github.com/j9t/css-optimization-basics/issues/new) for every problem you findâ€”and get mentioned as a book contributor.
2. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/j9t/css-optimization-basics/pulls) for specific fixes and suggestionsâ€”and, if accepted, get mentioned as a book contributor, too.

With increasing quality and maturity of the book, the price of ebook may go up (probably only up to the price of [some of Jensâ€™s self-published books](https://www.amazon.com/Jens-Oliver-Meiert/e/B0045A1CDA?tag=j9t-21-20)). That still wonâ€™t be much for a tech book, even a short one, but the idea is to give those who buy a copy a good deal. Remember that everyone can always grab the free version or an update here, so whoeverâ€™s purchasing a copyâ€”and that would greatly help [Jensâ€™s work](https://meiert.com/en/)â€”please keep that in mind, as book _updates_ may or may not be available for any editions of the book appearing on sale anywhere outside of Leanpub.

This just for a start. The book is open as everythingâ€™s public and free, and itâ€™s living as itâ€™s going to be maintained both by Jens as well as everyone who likes to help make it better. ðŸ¥‚
